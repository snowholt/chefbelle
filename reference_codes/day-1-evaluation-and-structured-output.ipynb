    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course. In this notebook, you'll learn some techniques for evaluating the output of a language model. As part of the evaluation, you will also use Gemini's structured data capability to produce evaluation results as instances of Python types.\n",

    "Note: This notebook is more code-heavy than the first Day 1 notebook ([Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/)). This notebook is not a prerequisite for days 2 and beyond, so feel free to skip over it, or come back later in the week. If you have not yet tried the [Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/) notebook, start there first as it introduces the fundamentals for interacting with LLMs.\n",

       "\n",
       "**Key Aspects of the Training Process:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Model Architecture:**\n",
       "    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer-based model.\n",
       "    *   It builds upon the research advances of Gemini 1.0 and a longer history of MoE research at Google.\n",
       "    *   MoE models use a learned routing function to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters for processing. This allows for a larger total parameter count while keeping the number of activated parameters constant.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Training Infrastructure:**\n",
       "    *   Trained on multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators.\n",
       "    *   The training is distributed across multiple datacenters.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Training Data:**\n",
       "    *   A variety of multimodal and multilingual data is used.\n",
       "    *   The pre-training dataset includes data sourced from various domains, including web documents, code, images, audio, and video content.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Instruction Tuning:**\n",
       "    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is fine-tuned on a collection of multimodal data containing paired instructions and appropriate responses.\n",
       "    *   Further tuning is based on human preference data.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Long-Context Understanding:**\n",
       "    *   The model incorporates significant architecture changes to enable long-context understanding of inputs up to 10 million tokens without degrading performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "6.  **Safety Mitigations:**\n",
       "    *   Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) are used to mitigate safety risks.\n",
       "    *   The safety mitigation is focused on adversarial or \"harm-inducing\" queries.\n",
       "    *   New image-to-text SFT data is incorporated, as safety SFT data for text-only queries was not as effective for harm-inducing image-to-text queries.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary:** The training process for Gemini 1.5 Pro involves a combination of a sophisticated MoE Transformer architecture, massive computational resources, diverse multimodal data, instruction tuning, and safety mitigations. The model is designed to handle extremely long contexts, enabling it to process and reason over large amounts of information from various modalities."

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "1.  **Gathering the Data (The Puppy's Learning Material):**\n",
       "    *   First, you need lots and lots of examples of text, images, audio, and video. Think of it as a huge library filled with books, pictures, songs, and movies.\n",
       "    *   This data is used to teach the model about the world and how language works.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Building the Model (The Puppy's Brain):**\n",
       "    *   The model is like a big, complicated computer program. It has lots of connections and settings that can be adjusted.\n",
       "    *   At the beginning, the model doesn't know anything. It's like a puppy with a brand new brain.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Training the Model (Teaching the Puppy):**\n",
       "    *   You feed the model the data you gathered earlier.\n",
       "    *   The model tries to predict what comes next in the data. For example, if you give it the sentence \"The cat sat on the...\", it might try to guess the next word.\n",
       "    *   If the model guesses correctly, you give it a little reward (like a treat for the puppy). If it guesses wrong, you give it a little correction.\n",
       "    *   The model adjusts its connections and settings based on the rewards and corrections. This is how it learns.\n",
       "    *   This process is repeated millions or billions of times. The model gets better and better at predicting what comes next.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Fine-Tuning (Polishing the Puppy's Skills):**\n",
       "    *   Once the model has learned the basics, you can fine-tune it for specific tasks.\n",
       "    *   For example, you might train it to answer questions, write stories, or translate languages.\n",
       "    *   This is like teaching the puppy specific tricks, like \"sit,\" \"stay,\" or \"fetch.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Evaluating and Improving (Checking the Puppy's Progress):**\n",
       "    *   You test the model to see how well it performs on different tasks.\n",
       "    *   If it makes mistakes, you analyze the mistakes and adjust the training process to improve the model.\n",
       "    *   This is like taking the puppy to obedience school and working with a trainer to fix any problems.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Ideas:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Lots of Data:** The more data the model sees, the better it learns.\n",
       "*   **Prediction:** The model learns by trying to predict what comes next.\n",
       "*   **Adjustments:** The model adjusts its connections and settings based on feedback.\n",
       "*   **Iteration:** The training process is repeated many times to improve the model.\n",

The puppy learns by seeing lots of examples, making guesses, and getting feedback. Over time, it becomes very good at understanding and responding to language.\n",

    "\n",
    "### LLM limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n",
