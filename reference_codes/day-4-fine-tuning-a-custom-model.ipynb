    "# Day 4 - Fine tuning a custom model\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will use the Gemini API to fine-tune a custom, task-specific model. Fine-tuning can be used for a variety of tasks from classic NLP problems like entity extraction or summarisation, to creative tasks like stylised generation. You will fine-tune a model to classify the category a piece of text (a newsgroup post) into the category it belongs to (the newsgroup name).\n",
    "\n",
    "This codelab walks you tuning a model with the API. [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/tune) also supports creating new tuned models directly in the web UI, allowing you to quickly create and monitor models using data from Google Sheets, Drive or your own files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We recommend doing this codelab first today. There may be a period of waiting while the model tunes, so if you start with this one, you can try the other codelab while you wait."

      "You are right to be confused! Pontiac's Bonneville line in 1988-89 was a bit of a mess. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bonneville Models Explained**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Base Bonneville:**  The most basic model. Usually had a 3.8L V6 engine and a more basic interior.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **LE:**  This stood for \"Luxury Edition\" and typically came with a bit more standard equipment, like upgraded upholstery, power options, and possibly a 5.0L V8 engine. \n",
      "\n",
      "* **SE:**  This stood for \"Sport Edition.\" These cars were geared towards a more sporty persona, with features like a firmer suspension, sport wheels, and sometimes a more powerful engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **LSE:**  This is where things get tricky. LSE could stand for \"Luxury Sport Edition,\" which combined features from the LE and SE trims. It also sometimes meant \"Limited Sport Edition,\" which typically had unique styling cues and more limited production.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **SSE:**  The \"SSE\" signified \"Special Service Edition.\"  These models had the 5.0L V8 engine and other performance-enhancing features.  The \"SSE\" designation was a bit confusing because sometimes they were just a specific package on a base Bonneville rather than a separate trim level.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **SSEi:**  This was a new model for 1989 and was intended as a high-performance variant of the Bonneville. It came with a larger 3.8L V6 engine with electronic fuel injection and other enhancements.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Book Value and Pricing**\n",
      "\n",
      "It's impossible to give you a precise book value for an '89 Bonneville without knowing the specific model, mileage, condition, and location. However, you can use websites like Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds to get an estimate based on this information. \n",
      "\n",
      "Generally,  you can expect to pay less than book value, especially for cars that are older and have higher mileage.  The demand for classic Bonnevilles can fluctuate depending on the model, condition, and time of year. Mid-spring to early summer is generally a good time to buy, as dealerships may be more willing to negotiate to clear out inventory.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Negotiating**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some tips for negotiating a good price:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Research:**  Know what the fair market value of the car is before you negotiate.\n",
      "* **Be Patient:**  Don't rush into a deal. Take your time and shop around.\n",
      "* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:**  If you're not happy with the price, be prepared to walk away.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Condition:**  A well-maintained Bonneville can be a reliable car, but they can also have issues. Pay close attention to the car's condition and be prepared to spend some money on repairs.\n",
      "* **Parts Availability:**  Parts for older Bonnevilles can be harder to find, so make sure you can get the parts you need if something breaks.\n",
