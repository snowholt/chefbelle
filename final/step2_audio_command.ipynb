    "This notebook implements the second step of our Interactive Recipe & Kitchen Management Assistant capstone project for the Google Gen AI Intensive Course. We'll create a voice interface that allows users to interact with our recipe assistant through spoken commands, recognize different types of user requests, and maintain user preferences.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Interactive Recipe & Kitchen Management Assistant helps users:\n",
    "1. Discover recipes based on available ingredients\n",
    "2. Customize recipes according to dietary needs\n",
    "3. Receive step-by-step cooking guidance\n",

    "This notebook focuses on the **Audio understanding** Gen AI capability, which enables our assistant to:\n",
    "- Process voice commands using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text\n",
    "- Correctly interpret user intent from natural language\n",
    "- Store and retrieve user preferences for personalized experiences"

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've completed Step 2 of our Interactive Recipe & Kitchen Management Assistant:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implemented audio processing and integration with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API\n",
    "2. Created a command parsing system to extract user intent and entities\n",
    "3. Developed a confirmation flow to verify understood commands\n",
    "4. Built a user preference storage system that maintains dietary preferences and command history\n",
    "5. Created a unified interface that supports both voice and text inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "We've demonstrated the **Audio understanding** Gen AI capability by:\n",
    "- Converting speech to text using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text\n",
    "- Parsing natural language commands to extract structured information\n",
    "- Confirming the system's understanding with the user\n",
    "- Taking appropriate actions based on understood commands\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next steps:**\n",
    "- Step 3: Implement few-shot prompting for recipe customization\n",
    "- Step 4: Create RAG implementation for recipe knowledge retrieval\n",
    "- Step 5: Develop function calling capabilities for specific recipe operations\n",
    "\n",
    "This audio and command recognition system will serve as the foundation for user interaction in our recipe assistant, allowing natural language queries and commands to control the more advanced AI capabilities we'll implement in subsequent steps."

    "## Environment Adaptation for Kaggle\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're working in a Kaggle notebook environment which doesn't support real-time microphone access, we'll modify our approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use pre-recorded audio samples**: We'll use sample audio files instead of live microphone capture\n",
    "2. **Focus on simulation**: We'll demonstrate the workflow with simulated audio processing\n",
    "3. **Make code portable**: The code will be structured to work in both Kaggle (simulation mode) and local environments (with real audio capture if available)\n",

    "1. **No microphone access**: Kaggle notebooks run in a containerized environment without access to microphone hardware\n",
    "2. **Limited system library installation**: Installing system dependencies like PortAudio is problematic\n",
    "3. **Focus on batch processing**: Kaggle is optimized for data science workflows, not real-time audio applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Our adaptation strategy:\n",
    "- Use pre-recorded or synthetic audio samples instead of live recording\n",
    "- Simulate the speech-to-text conversion that would normally use Google Cloud API\n",
    "- Provide a dropdown to select commands rather than speaking them\n",
    "- Focus on demonstrating the workflow and Gen AI capabilities, despite the platform limitations\n",
    "\n",
