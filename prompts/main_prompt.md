# Interactive Recipe & Kitchen Management Assistant Development Guide

## Project Overview
I'm working on the Interactive Recipe & Kitchen Management Assistant Capstone project for the Google Gen AI Intensive Course. This guide outlines the implementation approach, progress tracking, and next steps.

## Development Process

### Implementing the Next Step
- Review the previous progress report in `prompts/progress_report.md`
- Implement the next step as specified in `prompts/nextstep.md`
- After implementation, update the progress report with what was accomplished
- Ensure each Gen AI capability is clearly highlighted and explained

### Step Implementation Approach
- Proceed to implement the next specified step by creating a notebook, and using the data that is available by `final/step1_data_setup.ipynb`  , using the provided full codebase and the previous progress report which contains completed steps so far.

- Ensure each notebook section has both explanatory markdown and working code
- Focus on demonstrating the Gen AI capabilities clearly
- Focus using Google products, google api for implementing the requested tasks.
- Ensure using the reference_codes/ notebooks as guidance for implementing steps.



## Progress Tracking

After implementing each step:

1. Update the `prompts/progress_report.md` with:
   - Summary of what was implemented
   - Key technologies and Gen AI capabilities demonstrated
   - Challenges encountered and solutions applied
   - Code snippets highlighting important implementations
   - Visualizations or outputs demonstrating functionality

2. Define the next step in `prompts/nextstep.md`:
   - Clear description of the next feature to implement
   - Tech stack and tools to use
   - Expected inputs and outputs
   - Success criteria

## Quality Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow Kaggle notebook best practices
- Include descriptive markdown cells explaining the approach
- Document each Gen AI capability implementation clearly
- Add comments to complex code sections

### Gen AI Implementation Standards
- For each Gen AI capability:
  - Explain the theory/concept first
  - Show the implementation code
  - Demonstrate working examples
  - Discuss limitations and potential improvements

### Assumptions & Clarity
- If something appears missing from the plan, ask clear follow-up questions with proposed solutions or multiple choice options to clarify before coding.

### Testing Requirements
- Include sample inputs and expected outputs
- Show error handling for edge cases
- Demonstrate how the system responds to various user inquiries

## Presentation Requirements
- Create visualizations that clearly demonstrate the system's capabilities
- Format outputs in an easy-to-understand manner
- Include both technical explanations and user-friendly demonstrations
- Document the flow from user input to system output
