# Gen AI Intensive Course Capstone 2025Q1

Capstone project to apply & show what you've learned throughout the 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google!

## What is the Capstone Project?

The capstone project is an opportunity for you to apply what you've learned in the course and submit it for review.

## Prizes

The top 10 teams will be given Kaggle swag and their work will be highlighted by Kaggle and Google social media.

## Description

You must demonstrate what you've learned in this course by applying it to a use case of your choosing in a Kaggle Notebook. You must demonstrate in your code at least three (3) of the generative AI capabilities you learned in this course (see the Gen AI capabilities section below).

Optionally, you can also submit the following to add to your Capstone Project:

- **A blogpost**: a public blogpost on your capstone project. Think of this blogpost as an opportunity to explain what use case you chose, what problem/idea you were trying to solve, and how you solve it with Gen AI.
- **A YouTube video**: a public YouTube video on your capstone project. No minimum or maximum duration.

The use case is open-ended so feel free to be creative, but should ideally solve a real-world problem. You can also find some ideas in the "Use Case Ideas" section below.

## Evaluation

An entry to the competition consists of a Notebook submission. Bonus multipliers are awarded for the optional Blogpost submission (up to 1.5x) and YouTube video submission (up to 1.5x).

### Requirements

The notebooks must have the following minimum requirements, otherwise will be given a score of 0:

- Compilability of the notebook: the notebook must work without errors when executed end-to-end
- Minimum three (3) gen AI capabilities used in the notebook: see list of capabilities in Gen AI Capabilities
- The Kaggle notebook (and blogpost & video, if available) must be publicly viewable

### Maximum Score

The maximum score for a submission is 22.5:

- Notebook: 10 pts max
- Blogpost: Bonus multiplier up to 1.5x
- Video: Bonus multiplier up to 1.5x

Maximum total = 10 (Notebook) * 1.5 (Blogpost) * 1.5 (Video)

### Notebook scoring (out of 10 points):

**Use Case and Innovation** (up to 5 points for the Notebook):
- How creative, novel, innovative, or impactful is the use case?
- How well-suited is the usage of the gen AI capabilities to the use case shown?

**Documentation quality** (up to 5 points for the Notebook):
- How clear is the notebook documented? (if it's only code cells, the score would be 0)
- Does the notebook start with a clear use case or problem, and how gen AI can solve the problem?
- Does the notebook show and explain how the problem is solved in code with gen AI?

### Blogpost (Bonus multiplier up to 1.5x):
- Does the blogpost communicate a clear use case or problem, and how gen AI can solve the problem?
- Does the blogpost show some snippets of code to demonstrate how it was implemented?
- Does the blogpost talk about limitations of the technology or approach, and/or future art-of-the-possible?

### YouTube video (Bonus multiplier up to 1.5x):
- Does the YouTube video have a combination of visuals and a voiceover?
- Does the YouTube video have a good combination of technical explanation and storytelling?

## Judging

Judges will consist of gen AI experts across engineering and marketing at Google.

## Gen AI Capabilities

In your Capstone Project, you must demonstrate at least three (3) of the gen AI capabilities from the list below:

- Structured output/JSON mode/controlled generation
- Few-shot prompting
- Document understanding
- Image understanding
- Video understanding
- Audio understanding
- Function Calling
- Agents
- Long context window
- Context caching
- Gen AI evaluation
- Grounding
- Embeddings
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
- Vector search/vector store/vector database
- MLOps (with GenAI)

## Teams

- You can submit as an individual or a team.
- Only one submission per participant will count, whether you submit as an individual or as part of a team. If your team makes multiple submissions, your most recent will be considered.
- A team must have at most four (4) participants.

## Use case ideas

Below are some sample use case ideas, for inspiration. You are not limited to these ideas.

- Summarize the latest news or YouTube videos on any topic
- Create a RAG application to help you understand the rules of any board game
- Create a customer support agent

## Submission Instructions

- **Competition opens**: Fri April 4 at 9:00 AM Pacific Time
- **Submission deadline**: Sun April 20 at 11:59 PM Pacific Time

### Making your submission

- Complete the ➡️ Google Form here ⬅️ to submit your capstone project
- You must complete the form and hit "Submit" for your Capstone Project to be submitted
- You can make multiple submissions, but only the last submission will count, based on the timestamp of your submission
- If you, or any of your team members as listed in the Google Form, have made multiple submissions, all other previous submissions by any of the team members will be nullified, and only the last entry will be used in scoring based on the timestamp. This is done to ensure each participant has only one submission.

### Winners announcement

- **Winners will be announced**: Fri April 25 at 9:00 AM Pacific Time
- The winners (top 10 teams) will be shared here in this competition page (keep an eye on the Discussion forum) and on social media.
- The winning teams will be given Kaggle swag and their work will be highlighted by Kaggle and Google social media.
