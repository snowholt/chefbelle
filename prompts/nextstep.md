# LangGraph Implementation Plan for Kitchen Management Assistant

## Introduction

This document outlines the plan for implementing a LangGraph-based workflow for our Interactive Recipe & Kitchen Management Assistant. LangGraph will allow us to create a stateful, graph-based application that effectively leverages the various components we've already built.

## 1. State Schema Definition

### Title: Define the Core State Schema

#### Description
Define the TypedDict schema for our assistant's state, which will be passed between different nodes in the graph.

#### Task Details
- Create a `KitchenState` TypedDict with appropriate annotations
- Include conversation history tracking
- Define slots for current recipe search parameters
- Add storage for recipe customization requests
- Include user preference tracking

#### Implementation Example
```python
from typing import Annotated, List, Dict, Optional, Any
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class KitchenState(TypedDict):
    """State representing the kitchen assistant conversation."""
    # The chat conversation history
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    
    # Search parameters for finding recipes
    search_params: Dict[str, Any]
    
    # Current recipe under consideration
    current_recipe: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    
    # User's dietary preferences
    dietary_preferences: List[str]
    
    # Flag indicating end of conversation
    finished: bool
```
