# Next Implementation Step: Audio Input & Command Recognition

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details for Step 2 of the Interactive Recipe & Kitchen Management Assistant project, focusing on enabling voice commands through audio input and text command recognition.

## Step to Implement
Step 2: Audio Input & Command Recognition with User Preferences

## Description
In this step, we will implement the voice interface that allows users to interact with the recipe assistant through spoken commands. We'll also develop a text-based input alternative and create a system for storing and retrieving user preferences. This step forms the foundation of the user interaction layer of our assistant.

## Technical Requirements
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for voice recognition
- Python libraries for audio recording and processing
- JSON-based local storage for user preferences
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Regex for command parsing
- Ensure using the reference_codes/ notebooks (particularly day-1-prompting.ipynb) as guidance for implementing steps

## Gen AI Capabilities to Demonstrate
- **Audio understanding**: Using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to convert user's spoken commands into text
- **Structured output**: Creating structured format for commands and preferences
- **Few-shot prompting**: Implementing a basic version of few-shot prompting to recognize different command variations

## Implementation Approach
1. Set up the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
   - Create service account and credentials
   - Configure Python environment for API access
2. Implement audio recording and processing functions
   - Create function to record audio from microphone
   - Implement audio preprocessing (format conversion, noise reduction)
3. Develop speech-to-text conversion
   - Send audio to Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
   - Retrieve and parse textual results
4. Implement command confirmation flow
   - Create function to verify understood commands with user
   - Add correction mechanisms for misinterpreted speech
5. Set up user preference storage
   - Design JSON schema for user preferences
   - Create functions to save/load preferences from local storage
6. Develop command parsing logic
   - Create functions to identify command intents
   - Extract ingredients, dietary preferences, etc. from commands
7. Implement text input alternative
   - Create unified interface that works with both voice and text
8. Connect all components with the Step 1 recipe dataset
   - Enable querying recipes based on commands

## Expected Inputs
- Voice recordings of user commands (simulated via audio files for Kaggle environment)
- Sample commands:
  - "Find a recipe with chicken and pasta"
  - "What can I make with tomatoes, cheese, and basil?"
  - "Show me gluten-free dessert recipes"
  - "Save my preference for vegetarian recipes"

## Expected Outputs
- Transcribed text from audio input
- Confirmation of understood commands
- Structured command representations (JSON format):
  ```json
  {
    "intent": "find_recipe",
    "ingredients": ["chicken", "pasta"],
    "dietary_restrictions": [],
    "meal_type": null
  }
  ```
- User preference storage in JSON format:
  ```json
  {
    "dietary_preferences": ["vegetarian"],
    "favorite_recipes": [123, 456],
    "avoided_ingredients": ["cilantro"]
  }
  ```

## Success Criteria
- Successfully transcribe at least 90% of clearly spoken commands
- Correctly identify intent in at least 85% of commands
- Extract key entities (ingredients, dietary preferences) from commands
- Store and retrieve user preferences correctly
- Provide confirmation and correction mechanisms for misunderstood commands
- Ensure consistent experience between voice and text inputs

## Testing Approach
- Test with a variety of voice commands (different phrasings, accents)
- Test intent recognition with diverse command structures
- Verify entity extraction with different ingredient lists
- Test preference storage and retrieval for consistency
- Validate command confirmation flow with deliberately ambiguous commands

## Documentation Requirements
- Clear explanation of audio processing pipeline
- Documentation of Google Cloud Speech-to-Text integration
- Description of command parsing methodology
- Examples of successful command recognition
- Explanation of user preference storage structure
- Demonstration of the confirmation flow

## Integration with Previous Steps
- Connect to recipe dataset from Step 1
- Ensure commands can query and filter recipes based on ingredients and dietary tags
- Prepare for integration with few-shot prompting in Step 3

## Points to Consider
- In Kaggle environment, simulating microphone input may be challenging; consider using pre-recorded audio files
- Prepare for handling ambiguous commands (e.g., "Find a pasta recipe" - what kind of pasta?)
- Consider approximate matching for ingredients (e.g., "tomato" should match "cherry tomatoes")
- Design user preference storage for easy expansion in future steps
- Consider how to handle compound commands ("Find a chicken recipe and save it to my favorites")
