# Next Implementation Step: Few-Shot Prompting for Recipe Customization

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details for Step 3 of the Interactive Recipe & Kitchen Management Assistant project, focusing on recipe customization through few-shot prompting.

## Step to Implement
Step 3: Few-Shot Prompting for Recipe Customization

## Description
In this step, we will implement a few-shot prompting system to customize recipes according to user needs. We'll create example templates for common recipe customization scenarios such as dietary restrictions, ingredient substitutions, cooking method changes, and serving size adjustments. This will allow users to transform existing recipes to fit their specific requirements.

## Technical Requirements
- Gemini API for few-shot prompting implementation
- Python libraries for JSON handling and text processing
- Integration with the recipe dataset from Step 1
- Connection to user preferences from Step 2
- Ensure using the reference_codes/ notebooks (particularly day-1-prompting.ipynb) as guidance for implementation

## Gen AI Capabilities to Demonstrate
- **Few-shot prompting**: Using example pairs to teach the model how to handle recipe customization requests
- **Structured output**: Generating standardized JSON outputs for modified recipes
- **Contextual understanding**: Adapting recipes based on context like dietary needs or available ingredients

## Implementation Approach
1. Design example prompts for recipe customization
   - Create 5-7 example pairs of input requests and expected outputs
   - Cover different customization scenarios (dietary, substitution, scaling, etc.)
2. Implement few-shot prompting system
   - Set up the Gemini API with appropriate parameters
   - Create prompts that include examples and instructions
3. Define structured output schema
   - Design a JSON schema for modified recipes
   - Include fields for modified ingredients, steps, and cooking time
4. Develop substitution logic
   - Create functions to handle common ingredient substitutions
   - Build rules for scaling quantities and adjusting cooking times
5. Implement customization validation
   - Check if requested modifications are feasible
   - Provide alternatives if exact customization isn't possible
6. Connect with user preferences
   - Integrate with the preference system from Step 2
   - Apply stored dietary preferences automatically
7. Create interactive interface
   - Allow users to request customizations via text or voice
   - Display before/after recipe comparisons

## Expected Inputs
- Recipe customization requests such as:
  - "I need a gluten-free version of this pasta recipe"
  - "Make this recipe low-sodium but still flavorful"
  - "I don't have eggs, what can I substitute?"
  - "Convert this to an air fryer recipe"
  - "Make this recipe for 8 people instead of 4"
- Recipe IDs or titles to be customized
- Optional user preferences to consider

## Expected Outputs
- Structured recipe customization in JSON format:
  ```json
  {
    "original_recipe": {
      "title": "Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies",
      "ingredients": ["flour", "butter", "sugar", "eggs", "chocolate chips"],
      "steps": ["Mix dry ingredients", "Cream butter and sugar", "Add eggs", "Fold in chocolate chips", "Bake"]
    },
    "customized_recipe": {
      "title": "Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies",
      "ingredients": ["gluten-free flour", "butter", "sugar", "eggs", "chocolate chips"],
      "steps": ["Mix dry ingredients", "Cream butter and sugar", "Add eggs", "Fold in chocolate chips", "Bake for 2 extra minutes"],
      "modifications": [
        {"type": "substitution", "original": "flour", "replacement": "gluten-free flour"},
        {"type": "cooking_time", "change": "+2 minutes"}
      ]
    },
    "customization_notes": "Gluten-free flour may result in a slightly different texture. Consider adding 1/4 tsp xanthan gum if available."
  }
  ```
- Human-readable explanations of the modifications made
- Visual comparison between original and modified recipes

## Success Criteria
- Successfully handle at least 5 different types of customization requests
- Generate valid, executable recipe modifications
- Maintain the essence and flavor profile of the original recipe
- Provide clear explanations for why each modification was made
- Achieve at least 85% user satisfaction with customization results (simulated for demonstration)

## Testing Approach
- Test with diverse recipe types (baking, cooking, different cuisines, etc.)
- Try multiple customization types (dietary, ingredient substitution, etc.)
- Verify the feasibility of the modified recipes
- Check edge cases like multiple simultaneous modifications
- Validate the structured output format against the defined schema

## Documentation Requirements
- Clear explanation of the few-shot prompting methodology
- Examples of successful recipe customizations
- Documentation of the JSON schema for customized recipes
- Explanation of the customization logic and rules
- Demonstration of different customization types
- Comparison visualizations of original vs. modified recipes

## Integration with Previous Steps
- Use recipe data from Step 1 as the source for customization
- Leverage user preferences from Step 2 to inform customization choices
- Maintain the same command structure from Step 2 for consistency

## Points to Consider
- Account for complex substitutions that might require multiple ingredients
- Consider nutrition impact of substitutions when possible
- Handle cases where exact substitutions aren't possible
- Provide alternatives when a customization might significantly impact taste
- Consider cooking technique changes required by substitutions (different temperatures, times)
- Make sure scaled recipes adjust both ingredients and cooking containers/times
