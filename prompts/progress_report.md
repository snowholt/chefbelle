**Key Implementation Details**:
```python
# Loading the real Food.com dataset from Kaggle
recipes_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions/RAW_recipes.csv')
interactions_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions/RAW_interactions.csv')

# Converting string representations to Python lists
recipes_df['ingredients'] = recipes_df['ingredients'].apply(eval)
recipes_df['steps'] = recipes_df['steps'].apply(eval)
recipes_df['tags'] = recipes_df['tags'].apply(eval)

# Function to normalize ingredient names
def normalize_ingredients(ingredient_list):
    """
    Normalize ingredient names by removing quantities and standardizing format
    """
    normalized = []
    if isinstance(ingredient_list, list):
        for ingredient in ingredient_list:
            # Skip empty ingredients
            if not ingredient or not isinstance(ingredient, str):
                continue
            
            # Remove quantities
            cleaned = re.sub(r'^\d+\s+\d+/\d+\s+', '', ingredient)
            cleaned = re.sub(r'^\d+/\d+\s+', '', cleaned)
            cleaned = re.sub(r'^\d+\s+', '', cleaned)
            
            # Convert to lowercase and strip whitespace
            cleaned = cleaned.lower().strip()
            
            normalized.append(cleaned)
    return normalized

# Function to identify dietary tags based on ingredients
def identify_dietary_tags(ingredients):
    """
    Identify dietary preferences based on ingredients
    """
    # Handle empty ingredients list
    if not ingredients or not isinstance(ingredients, (list, str)):
        return []
        
    ingredients_str = ' '.join(ingredients).lower()
    
    tags = []
    
    # Vegetarian check
    meat_ingredients = ['chicken', 'beef', 'pork', 'lamb', 'turkey', 'veal', 'bacon']
    if not any(meat in ingredients_str for meat in meat_ingredients):
        tags.append('vegetarian')
        
        # Vegan check
        animal_products = ['cheese', 'milk', 'cream', 'yogurt', 'butter', 'egg', 'honey']
        if not any(product in ingredients_str for product in animal_products):
            tags.append('vegan')
    
    # Additional dietary checks...
    
    return tags
```

**Challenges & Solutions**:
- **Challenge**: Loading and processing the large Food.com dataset in Kaggle environment
- **Solution**: Implemented optimized data processing with proper error handling and column parsing

- **Challenge**: Dealing with column naming discrepancies (e.g., 'name' vs 'title')
- **Solution**: Created a flexible column mapping system to standardize column names

- **Challenge**: Performance issues with heavy data processing operations
- **Solution**: Replaced resource-intensive operations like `describe(include='all')` with targeted, lighter analytics

- **Challenge**: Parsing string representations of lists in the dataset
- **Solution**: Implemented robust parsing with error handling for ingredients, steps, and tags columns

- **Challenge**: Automatically identifying dietary preferences from ingredient lists
- **Solution**: Created a rule-based system that analyzes ingredient compositions to assign appropriate tags

**Output Example**:
```
Successfully loaded 231637 recipes
Successfully loaded 1132367 interactions

Sample recipe from final dataset:
Title: Delightful Strawberry Cake
